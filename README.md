# Our Purpose
In today's post-Covid era, mental health among students remains widely viewed as poor. At the same time, inadequate sleep is also widely viewed as having negative implications for one's psychological and physical health. In this project, we wanted to examine how poor mental health interacts with inadequate sleep among high school students, particularly if there's a notable relationship between the two. The scope of this project is, undoubtedly, quite limited, and doesn't investigate causal factors. It merely seeks to identify a potential correlation between these variables.

Note: Our project contains data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) recorded from the year 2023.
